I am a 3rd year computer science major at UC San Diego. My favorite language is Python and I've used it heavily in my past internships. I have pursued computer science because I want to make ~~lots of money~~ the world a better place. If you want to see what I look like, click [here](#Photos of me).

Here is my favorite quote of all time:

Here is fizzbuzz in Python:
```
def fizzbuzz(n):
    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
        return 'FizzBuzz'
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        return 'Fizz'
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        return 'Buzz'
    else:
        return str(n)
```
